### CC Set
CC does the custom crit for a single type of damage. It prompts the user for the number of dice, the damage die type, the modifier, and the type of damage. The output would then, for example, be 12 + 2d6 + 3 = X Piercing damage. 

CC-2type covers attacks that deal two types of damage. It prompts the user for multiple damage types, then prompts for the same as CC, but for both damage types. The output would then, for example, be 12 + 2d6 + 3 = X Piercing damage, and 4 + 1d4 + 0 = Y Fire damage.

The CC-alt flavours show the damage broken down as the max roll + the true roll. The output then, for example, looks like 12 + X Piercing damage.
